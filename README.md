Final Project for CSE190: Reinforcement Learning

This project is an extension of PA3. In this project, we implemented algorithm for reinforcement learning.

Two different configuration files can be used: qlearn_config.json and qlearn_config2.json.
Users can change the json file name in read_config.py to run on either configuration.

To run this project: roslaunch cse_190_assi_3 solution_python.launch
