Final Project for CSE190: Reinforcement Learning

This project is an extension of PA3. In this project, we implemented algorithm for reinforcement learning.
Source code for this algorithm can be found in qlearn.py and settings.py

Two different configuration files can be used: qlearn_config.json and qlearn_config2.json.
Users can change the json file name in read_config.py to run on either configuration.

Results are published in a file called qlearn_policy_list.json.

To run this project: roslaunch cse_190_assi_3 solution_python.launch
